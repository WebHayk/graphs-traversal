# graphs-traversal
This repository offers JavaScript implementations of graph traversal algorithms, including depth-first and breadth-first search. It efficiently explores nodes in directed and undirected graphs, with examples for connected components, cycle detection, and pathfinding. Ideal for learning or integrating graph traversal in JavaScript projects.
